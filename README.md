# Wired RSS Reader
This is sample RSS reader app for Android developed in Kotlin which I believe it might be a useful source for those who want to see how Kotlin language works in Android development. It also demonstrates how [xtoj](https://github.com/atakanozceviz/xtoj) api works as well as using coroutines with suspend functions in Kotlin.

## Overview
This app basically retrieves the data from [wired](https://www.wired.com/) RSS channel in XML format. And converts it to the JSON using [xtoj](https://github.com/atakanozceviz/xtoj) and represents to the user in RecyclerView. Each item in the list contains title, image and keywords. When you click the one of the items on the list you will be directed to another Activity where you will find more detailed information about the article as well as five most repetitive words and their Turkish translations. I used [Yandex API](https://tech.yandex.com/translate/) for translation. You can obtain free API key from the website provided.
